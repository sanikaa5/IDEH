# Flask Application with PostgreSQL, LangChain, and Social Login

## Overview
This is a Flask web application that integrates PostgreSQL with Flask-SQLAlchemy, provides social login using Google OAuth, implements LangChain for prompt-based interactions, and includes a web scraping feature. Key features include PostgreSQL integration for data storage, Google OAuth authentication via Flask-Dance, web scraping, LangChain for prompt-based responses, and CRUD APIs for scraped data and prompts. The app is also containerized using Docker.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.x
- PostgreSQL
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```

4. Configure Environment Variables  
   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following configuration:  
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost/dbname  
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key  
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id  
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret  
   ```

5. Set Up PostgreSQL Database  
   Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and create a database named `yourdb` or configure it as per your `.env` settings.

6. Run the Application  
   Run the Flask development server:  
   ```bash
   python app.py  
   ```  
   The app should now be accessible at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
